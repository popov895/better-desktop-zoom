# Better Desktop Zoom

This extension makes the GNOME magnifier behave similarly to the Zoom desktop effect in KDE:

- press `Meta`+`=` to start zooming or increase the zoom level
- press `Meta`+`-` to decrease the zoom level or stop zooming
- zoom the desktop while scrolling with the `Ctrl`+`Super` keys pressed (Wayland only)

These shortcuts, as well as the zoom factor, can be changed in the extension preferences.
